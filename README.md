# LifeHack-2022

Hello, welcome to Team Trying Our Best's project for Lifehack 2022! We are a group of budding programmers who are quite new to all this.

We made a website to make NGOs more accessible to volunteers by gathering them on a general volunteering site.
It also helps educate the general public on the various kinds of volunteering they can engage in at one glance.

The logos under "Handicapped", "Environment", and "Animals" are clickable and will lead you to their respective websites.

Thank you for having us at Lifehack 2022! We learnt a lot from this experience!
